PicPass lets you login to any other app or website simply by 
  1. Entering a 4 digit PIN
  2. Tapping a sequence of 5 or more images (repeats allowed).
  
 PicPass will use these two to generate a complex secure and pseudo-random 30-character password containing
  - letters (capital and lowercase)
  - numbers
  - symbols ('!', '@')
  
  For devices running Android Oreo and up, PicPass supports the Android Autofill Framework
  for generating passwords when logging into a form on any app on the device.
